              This project aims to uncover the intricate interplay of social and economic barriers that shape mental health and impact academic and work performance among millennials and Gen-Z, who constitute 51 per cent of the population in India. In a society marked by cultural stratification and social inequalities, economic status severely restricts access to essential resources, fostering systemic discrimination and a pervasive sense of powerlessness. By engaging with youth and middle-aged adults through surveys and qualitative interviews, we will explore their lived experiences. This research will examine the relationships between self-efficacy, resilience, and locus of control across two generational cohorts: millennials and Gen-Z. Conducted in urban and rural regions of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, the study aims to identify critical psychological factors, providing valuable insights for mental health interventions and policies that champion social inclusion.

                In India, social and economic factors impact marginalised people, affecting resilience and mental health. However, little is known about the psychological processes—such as locus of control and self-efficacy—through which these factors affect well-being. This study is important because it attempts to close this gap by examining how social barriers affect resilience and mental health. It offers vital information for specialised actions and legislative decisions that advance equality and social inclusion. Because it can direct the creation of successful interventions and policies to advance social inclusion and equality, this research has a substantial potential influence on policymaking.
